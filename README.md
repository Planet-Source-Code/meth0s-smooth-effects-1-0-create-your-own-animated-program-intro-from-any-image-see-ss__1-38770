### Description

Smooth Effects 1.0 Will take any normal image that you specifie and make a working application intro from it! Smooth Effects 1.0 steps through each section of a image grabbing the cordinece once every set ammount of pixel's giving the image a floating cut out effect. on top of that the floating layers will move any direction while bouncing off the walls and still staying in propper order.

No need to sift through my code to make your own intro! I have built in a intro creator that will generate all needed source code to create your very own intro with your very own image!

Project includes 3 sample projects which where created with Smooth Effects along with 5 sample images you can play around with.
